# Find Ten Seconds Tile Game

 "Find Ten Seconds" is a fast-paced tile-matching game  where the goal is to pair similar tiles based on matching  characteristics. Players select a tile and then search for  a second one that closely matches it, earning points based  on the similarities between the two tiles. Each round  requires finding ten pairs before the board refreshes, and  every ten seconds, a tile disappears from the board,  adding urgency to the gameplay. The game features  customizable settings, hidden easter eggs, and a dynamic  soundtrack with an option to mute. Built from scratch  using P5.js, "Find Ten Seconds" offers a quick and  engaging challenge that rewards sharp observation and  quick decision-making.
